## About Me

This is my personal portfolio built with Next.js (TypeScript) and Tailwind CSS‚Äîcurrently functional but intentionally minimal since I‚Äôve always struggled with UI/UX. Major props to DevPortfolio‚Äôs free templates for the design inspiration and basic starting design.

I‚Äôm a full-stack developer focused on building scalable, accessible web solutions. My expertise spans backend architecture, clean and intuitive UI design (even if it‚Äôs wonky at the start), and AI integration, all geared toward solving complex problems efficiently. Most of my coding experience comes from professional and academic projects, but I‚Äôve recently ramped up personal builds to stretch myself creatively and technically. This portfolio is a living project‚Äîcheck back often for updates.
